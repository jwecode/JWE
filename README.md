Joint Embeddings of Chinese Words, Characters, and Fine-grained Subcharacter Components
Word embeddings have attracted much attention recently given its simplicity of word representation and generalization ability for a lot of downstream tasks. Different from other writing systems such as Alphabet, Chinese is a kind of hieroglyphs and represents rich morphological information in its characters and subcharacter components as radicals and components themselves being a character. In this work, we propose an approach to jointly embed Chinese words as well as their characters and fine-grained subcharacter components.
We use three likelihoods to evaluate whether the context words, characters, and components can predict the current target word, and collected 13,253 subcharacter components to demonstrate the existing approaches of decomposing Chinese characters are not enough.
Evaluation on both word similarity and word analogy tasks demonstrates the superior performance of our model.
